Welcome to Scythe's documentation!
=======================================

Scythe is a library of tools that generate summaries of the data contained in scientific
data files. The goal of Scythe is to provide a shared resources of these tool to avoid
duplication of effort between the many emerging scientific databases. Each extractor is designed to
generate the sum of all data needed by each of these databases with a uniform API so that specific
projects can write simple adaptors for their needs.

Welcome to MaterialsIO's documentation!
=======================================

MaterialsIO is a library of tools that generate summaries of the data contained in scientific data files.
The goal of MaterialsIO is to provide a shared resources of these tool to avoid duplication of effort between the many emerging materials databases.
Each parser is designed to generate the sum of all data needed by each of these databases with a uniform API so that specific projects can write simple adaptors for their needs.

Setting up development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scythe makes use of the `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ project to manage
dependencies and packaging. To install the latest version of Scythe, first install poetry
following `their documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_. Once that's
done, clone/download the Scythe repository locally from
`Github <https://github.com/materials-data-facility/Scythe/>`_. Change into that directory
and run ``poetry install`` (it would be a good idea to create a new virtual environment for your
project first too, so as to not mix dependencies with your system environment).

By default, only a small subset of parsers will be installed (this is done so that you do not
need to install all the dependencies of parsers you may never use). To install additional
parsers, you can specify "extras" at install time using ``poetry``. Any of the values specified
in the ``[tool.poetry.extras]`` section of ``pyproject.toml`` can be provided, including ``all``,
which will install all bundled parsers and their dependencies. For example::

    poetry install -E all

Poetry wil create a dedicated virtual environment for the project and the Scythe code will
be installed in "editable" mode, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected when
running tests, importing parsers, etc. It will use the default version of python available.
Scythe is currently developed and tested against Python versions 3.8.12, 3.9.12, and 3.10.4.
We recommend using the `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ project to manage
various python versions on your system if this does not match your system version of Python. It
is required to use ``tox`` as well (see next paragraph). Make sure you install the versions
specified in the ``.python-version`` file by running commands such as ``pyenv install 3.8.12`` etc.

Additionally, the project uses `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_ to simplify common tasks and
to be able to run tests in isolated environments. This will be installed automatically as a
development package when running the ``poetry install`` command above. It can be used to run the
test suite with common settings, as well as building the documentation. For example, to
run the full Scythe test suite on all three versions of Python targetd, just run::

    poetry run tox

To build the HTML documentation (will be placed inside the ``./docs/_build/`` folder), run::

    poetry run tox -e docs

For the sake of speed, if you would like to focus your testing on just one Python version, you can
temporarily override the environment list from ``pyproject.toml`` with an enviornment variable.
For example, to only run the test/coverage suite on Python 3.8.X, run::

    TOXENV=py38 poetry run tox

Check out the ``[tool.tox]`` section of the ``pyproject.toml`` file to view how these tasks are
configured, and the `tox documentation <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html>`_ on how to add your
own custom tasks, if needed.

Finally, Scythe uses ``flake8`` to enforce code styles, which will be run for you
automatically when using ``tox`` as defined above. Any code-style errors, such as lines longer
than 100 characters, trailing whitespace, etc. will be flagged when running ``poetry run tox``.

The next part of the Scythe guide details how to add a new parser to the ecosystem.

Step 1: Implement the Parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a new parser is accomplished by implementing the
`BaseParser <user-guide.html#parser-api>`_ abstract class. If you are new to MaterailsIO, we
recommend reviewing the `User Guide <user-guide.html#available-methods>`_ first to learn about
the available methods of BaseParser. Minimally, you need only implement the ``parse``,
``version``, and ``implementors`` operations for a new parser. Each of these methods (and any
other methods you override) must be stateless, so that running the operation does not change the
behavior of the parser.

We also have subclasses of ``BaseParser`` that are useful for common types of parsers:

- ``BaseSingleFileParser``: Parsers that only ever evaluate a single file at a time

Class Attributes and Initializer
--------------------------------

The ``BaseParser`` class supports configuration options as Python class attributes.
These options are intended to define the behavior of a parser for a particular environment
(e.g., paths of required executables) or for a particular application (e.g., turning off unneeded
features). We recommend limiting these options to be only JSON-serializable data types and for
all to be defined in the ``__init__`` function to simplify text-based configuration files.

The initializer function should check if a parser has access to all required external tools, and
throw exceptions if not. For example, a parser that relies on calling an external command-line
tool should check whether the package is installed. In general, parsers should fail during
initialization and not during the parsing operation if the system in misconfigured.

Implementing ``parse``
----------------------

The ``parse`` method contains the core logic of a Scythe parser: rendering a summary of a
group of data files. We do not specify any particular schema for the output but we do recommend
best practices:


#. *Summaries must be JSON-serializable.*
    Limiting to JSON data types ensures summaries are readable by most software without specia
    libraries. JSON documents are also able to be documented easily.

#. *Human-readability is desirable.*
    JSON summaries should be understandable to users without expert-level knowledge of the data.
    Avoid unfamiliar acronyms, such as names of variables in a specific simulation code or settings
    specific to a certain brand of instrument.

#. *Adhere closely to the original format.*
    If feasible, try to stay close to the original data format of a file or the output of a library
    used for parsing. Deviating from already existing formats complicates modifications to a parser.

#. *Always return a dictionary.*
    If a parser can return multiple records from a single file group, return the list as an element
    of the dictionary. Any metadata that pertains to each of the sub-records should be stored as
    a distinct element rather than being duplicated in each sub-record.


We also have a recommendations for the parser behavior:

#. *Avoid configuration options that change only output format.*
    Parsers can take configuration options that alter the output format, but configurations
    should be used sparingly. A good use of configuration would be to disable complex parsing
    operations if unneeded. A bad use of configuration would be to change the output to match a
    different schema. Operations that significantly alter the form but not the content of a
    summary should be implemented as adaptors.

#. *Consider whether context should be configuration.*
    Settings that are identical for each file could be better suited as configuration settings
    than as context.

Implementing ``group``
----------------------

The ``group`` operation finds all sets of files in a user-provided list files and directories
that should be parsed together. Implementing ``group`` is optional. Implementing a new ``group``
method is required only when the default behavior of "each file is its own group" (i.e., the
parser only treats files individually) is incorrect.

The ``group`` operation should not require access to the content of the files or directories to
determine groupings. Being able to determine file groups via only file names improves performance
and allows for determining groups of parsable files without needing to download them from remote
systems.

Files are allowed to appear in more than one group, but we recommend generating only the largest
valid group of files to minimize the same metadata being generated multiple times.

It is important to note that that file groups are specific to a parser. Groupings of files that
are meaningful to one parser need not be meaningful to another. For that reason, limit the
definition of groups to sets of files that can be parsed together without consideration to what
other information makes the files related (e.g., being in the same directory).

Another appropriate use of the ``group`` operation is to filter out files which are very unlikely
to parse correctly. For example, a PDF parser could identify only files with a ".pdf" extension.
However, we recommend using filtering sparing to ensure no files are missed.

Implementing ``citations`` and ``implementors``
-----------------------------------------------

The ``citation`` and ``implementors`` methods identify additional resources describing a parser
and provide credit to contributors. ``implementors`` is required, as this operation is also used
to identify points-of-contact for support requests.

``citation`` should return a list of BibTeX-format references.

``implementors`` should return a list of people and, optionally, their contract information
in the form: "FirstName LastName <email@provider.com>".

Implementing ``version``
------------------------

We require using `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ for specifying the version of parsers.
As the API of the parser should remain unchanged, use versioning to indicate changes in available
options or the output schema. The ``version`` operation should return the version of the parser.


Step 2: Document the Parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The docstring for a parser must start with a short, one sentence summary of the parser, which
will be used by our autodocumentation tooling. The rest of the documentation should describe what
types of files are compatible, what context infomration can be used, and
summarize what types of metadata are generated.

.. todo:: Actually write these descriptors for the available parsers

The Scythe project uses JSON documents as the output for all parsers and
`JSON Schema <https://json-schema.org/>`_ to describe the content of the documents. The
BaseParser class includes a property, ``schema``, that stores a description of the output format.
We recommend writing your description as a separate file and having the ``schema`` property read
and output the contents of this file. See the
`GenericFileParser source code <https://github.com/materials-data-facility/Scythe/blob/master/scythe/file.py>`_
for a example.


Step 3: Register the Parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preferred Route: Adding the Parser to Scythe
-------------------------------------------------

If your parser has the same dependencies as existing parsers, add it to the existing module with
the same dependencies.

If your parser has new dependencies, create a new module for your parser in ``scythe``, and
then add the requirements as a new key in the ``[tool.poetry.extras]`` section of ``pyproject
.toml``, following the other parser examples in that section. Next, add your parser to
``docs/source/parsers.rst`` by adding an ``.. automodule::`` statement that refers to your new
module (again, following the existing pattern).

Scythe uses ``stevedore`` to simplify access to the parsers. After implementing and
documenting the parser, add it to the ``[tool.poetry.plugins."scythe.parser"]`` section of the
``pyproject.toml`` file for Scythe. See
`stevedore documentation for more information <https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/user/tutorial/creating_plugins.html#registering-the-plugins>`_
(these docs reference ``setup.py``, but the equivalent can be done via plugins in ``pyproject
.toml``; follow the existing structure if you're unsure, and ask for help from the developers if
you run into issues).


Alternative Route: Including Parsers from Other Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------

If a parser would be better suited as part of a different library, you can still register it as a
parser with Scythe by altering your ``pyproject.toml`` file. Add an entry point with the
namespace ``"scythe.parser"`` and point to the class object following the
`stevedore documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/user/tutorial/creating_plugins.html#registering-the-plugins>`_.
Adding the entry point will let Scythe use your parser if your library is installed in the
same Python environment as Scythe.

.. todo:: Provide a public listing of scythe-compatible software.

    So that people know where to find these external libraries
